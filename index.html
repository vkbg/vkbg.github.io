<p>The FAB Academy course is a six month duration course. When we attend the FAB Academy course we must completed the Pre FAB Academy course (4 weeks). He explained why we need a Prefab training and how it will help us while we take the Fab Academy course. Then Francisco first collect all students name & mail id and shared some documents in a folder via. google drive which we will use to store and share files. Then we had a discussion on what we will be doing in the first week in detail</p>
<h><b>Day 2 (20.10.2015)</h></b>
<p>Second day we started with how to prepare the documentation and debugging table. Francisco teached us to keep a separate note book for writing down all the points during the course of the workshop. It is insisted to use the same notebook if you are attending the FAB academy course</p> 

<p>Exp: we work in laser cutter, we need to note the bellow things</p>

<p>1.Date<br>
2.Machine used<br>
3.Material (thickness, type, colo...)<br>
4.Settings (speeds, feed rates...)<br>
5.Results (what worked, what didn't)<br>
6.Debugging</p>
The debugging time we make a work table.

<h4><b>Assignment:</h4></b> 
<h>Document what you do every day.</h>
<p>The documentation shall be done in such a way that in case of doing a machine operation Name of the work Name of the machine Spec Settings Measurements (if any) Having never used ubuntu before, when Francisco asked to install Ubuntu 14.4. My Laptop Specs: Model: Dell Inspiron 15z-5523 Ultrabook Processor: 3rd Gen Intel Core i7 processors and the performance-enhancing features of Windows 10 with 8 GB RAM. First am partition my hard disk, but its note it's not booting their. Francisco sad to me if your interested in the course you un install the windows and install the Ubuntu 14.04. I accept the advice and I formated and installing the Ubuntu 14.04. The important thing before installation of Ubuntu is to create partitions in the available hard disk space by opening Manage, Computer Management, Storage. My friend give a bootable pendrive with Ubuntu 14.04 OS.</p> 

<p>Boot from the pendrive. plugging in the boot able pendrive with Ubuntu 14.04 restart the computer and choose to boot from the pendrive. I  have to change my boot preferences by hitting the Setup (F12) key while my computer is restarting.</p>

<p>Navigate through the top menu bar and you can find Legacy Boot [Enable] [Disable] Press F10 and Save. Ubuntu opens up next objective is to create three partitions namely /, home and swap area. For / Memory : Primary Ext 24 Allocate space as per your choice (50 GB) For /home Memory: logical Ext 24 Space allocated: 100 GB For swap area Space allocated: 16 GB Install Ubuntu</p> 

<p><img src="img/1.jpg"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
Press the "Install Ubuntu" button.
<p><img src="img/2.jpg"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
click the "Continue" button.

select our keyboard layout "English (US)"
<p><img src="img/6.jpg"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
After install, enter our Name, Computer Name and Password. press the "Continue" button
<p>Once we have completed installing Ubuntu, update the OS by opening the Terminal (Ctrl+alt+t). apt-get update If this shows permission denied use the below command sudo apt-get update (sudo means super user do) Once you have successfully updated Ubuntu, the next step is to download the dependencies and for which log on to kokompe.cba.mit.edu Once that is done next step is to download the fab modules Unzip the fab module,open the folder, right click select open terminal here. If you couldnt find it you need to install nautilus (file manager) sudo apt-get install nautilus Install fab modules Then downlaod kokopelli.retro.zip (shared by francisco) extract make fab cd bin ./kokopelli Download antimony Search github antimony Open Intall Qt5.5 (an application, where in you can design software by placing buttons and corresponding codes are generated simultaneously) Install the following Clone antimony (for getting the antimony updated automatically) ~/Qt5.5.1/5.5/gcc_64/bin/qmake ../sb.pro, sudo make -j8, ./app/antimony - Antimony is not getting installed in my computer . Antimony installation time I faced some Problem - It didn't compile correctly for the first time. I ask my friend, he toled me "to delete the entire cloned folder, re-clone it and build again. After next time it got installe". Next time I installed the antimony getting installed successfully.</p> 
<p>Antimony Software instalation tips are shown bellow:</p>

<h1>Week 2</h1>
<h2>Day 5 <p>(26.10.2015)</p></h2>

(week 2 is to learn and use all the machines in each day)

<p>Today we learn the operation and how to install the <b>"Vinyl Cutter"</b>
<p>Using C Unix Printing System (CUPS 1.7.2) we created a new profile for the vinyl cutter. Case has to be taken while naming the device, it should be "vinyl" and it is case sensitive Then each of us made a design for cutting. I chose to cut out my initial (<b>BG</b>) . Then we were taught how to form a sticker properly and the steps to be
followed.

<p>first we type "http://localhost:631/" in a browser. CUPS 1.7.2 window opening.
<p><img src="img/16.png"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
select the "Adding Printers and Classes"(Administrator)

Enter our Admin User Name and Password and select our vinyl printer "usb/Roland/GX-24?serial=EBL8247"
<p><img src="img/20.png"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
Enter our printer Name "vinyl" and location, Click the "Continue" button
<p><img src="img/21.png"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
Select our printer make "Raw Queue(en)"
<p><img src="img/22.png"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
click the "Add Printer" button, finally the printer added in our computer.

<h2> Design Printing</h2>
first we start to design a logo and save to .png format.Then go to terminal 
<p><b>type:</p></b>"fab" - Enter  

<p><img src="img/23.png"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
<p>Select the i/p format (.png file)<br>
Select the o/p process (vinyl cutter)<br>
Select the workflow (program)
<p><img src="img/24.png"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
select top first "vinyl"<br>
click the "load.png" button and select our project work(.png).
<p><img src="img/25.png"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
click the "make.path" button and view type select "segments"
<p><img src="img/26.png"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
click the "make.camm" button and the project job send it to the vinyl cutter.
<p><img src="img/27.png"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
<p><img src="img/28.png"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
<p>first we check the vinyl sheet loaded properly in the vinyl cutter.we fix the vinyl sheet between the white marked area clse to left side of the vinyl cutter machine.
<p><img src="img/29.png"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
next we select the vinyl sheet is "roll or piece" 
<img src="img/30.jpg"style="width:300px;height:300px;">
<img src="img/31.jpg"style="width:300px;height:300px;">
<img src="img/32.png"style="width:300px;height:300px;"></p>
after selection of sheet we pointing our origin using right,left,up and down key. Once we pointed the origin press and hold (3 seconds) the origin button
<p>give a test print 
<p><img src="img/33.png"style="width:400px;height:400px;"></p>
first time test print was getting note OK, we check the cutting bit is broken using the magnifier.At last we found that cutting bit was broken.
<p><img src="img/34.png"style="width:400px;height:400px;"></p>
we change the broken bit and again try to print,we get the fine print.
<p><img src="img/35.png"style="width:200px;height:200px;">          <img src="img/36.png"style="width:200px;height:200px;"></p>
First one is my design and Secound one is vinyl cutter print out
<h1>Day 6</h1> <p><b>(27.10.2015)</b></p>

Today we learn the operation and how to install the <b>"Laser Cutter"</b>.
<p>Design was made in Inkscape and then the saved .svg file was copied to the PC connected to the Laser cutter.This has the necessary job control software for the machine installed. The software only runs in Windows OS,so we are switch to computers in windows.First I designed a small chair in a paper then I draw on  inkscape software and saved to .svg file. The design was coped and pasted to a pendrive. The pendrive to connect the windows system and the design pasted to the desktop of the computer.Then lasered a cardboard sheet of 3.6mm thickness. By trial and error we determined the cut and engrave speed and power. Make sure that we note down the optimal value are shown bellow.</p>

<b>1st Trial</b>
<p>our material 3mm acrylics sheet<br>
job		power(%),	speed(%),	Frequ(Hz)<br>
Engraving	75,		40,		1000<br>
Cutting		100,		10,		8000<br>

Result : it's not cut<br>

<p><b>2nd Trial</b>
<p>
job		power(%),	speed(%),	Frequ(Hz)<br>
Engraving	75,		40,		1000<br>
Cutting		100,		5,		8000<br>

we change the speed 10% to 5%<br>

Result : it's not cut<br>

<p><b>3rd Trial</b>
<p>
job		power(%),	speed(%),	Frequ(Hz)<br>
Engraving	75,		40,		1000<br>
Cutting		100,		1.5,		8000<br>

we change the speed 5% to 1.5%<br>

Result : it's cut<br>
<p>we save the parameter</p>


our laser model is trotec Speedy 100, it is CO2 laser type. the work area is 24x12 inch, laser powe is 12-60 watts. Francisco toled laser is a dangerous machine,risks that may occur.
<p>1.generation of fumes, ozone<br>
2.explosions<br>
3.high electrical tension<br>
4.burning and fire<br>

<p>The importance of focal positions in the laser cutting<br>
The laser can handle variations in focus of +/-2.5mm. Once it gets outside this the laser beam becomes wider (less focused) and this results in a thicker cutting line and ill-defined engraving.<br> 
<p><img src="img/37.png"style="width:600px;height:200px;"></p>
<b>Focus position</b>
<p><img src="img/38.png"style="width:400px;height:200px;"></p>
<p>Exact positioning of the focal point is an important requirement for good cutting results.<br>

<b>my project was a chair design</b>
 
<p><img src="img/39.png"style="width:600px;height:300px;"></p>
<img src="img/40.jpg"style="width:300px;height:200px;">  <img src="img/41.jpg"style="width:300px;height:200px;"></p>

<h1>Day 7</h1> <p><b>(28.10.2015)</b></p>

Today we learn the operation and how to install the <b>"3D Printer (Ultimaker 2)"</b>.
<p>We started with Antimony software. Made a 3D design file for keeping the head of the hot blower. Afternoon session was on 3-D printing.

<p><img src="img/42.png"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>
<p><img src="img/43.png"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>
<p><img src="img/44.png"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>
After design the object to save as to .stl file and save the desktop. The .stl file to open with cura software.
<p><img src="img/45.png"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>
And the file convert .stl to .gcode format and save to an Ultimaker 2 SD card. Print the file using the rotate able Nobe and display.
<p><img src="img/46.jpg"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>
<p><img src="img/47.jpg"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>
<p>Design: Take care of the leveling of the plate and make the distance between extruder head and the plate optimum. 45 degree is the maximum allowable slope. If it is higher than 45, the software will add support material. We must try to avoid the use of the support material. Positioning of the shape is also very crucial. The orientation will change according to the application of the printed object.</p> 
<p><b>Controllable parameters:</b></p>
<p>1.speed : slower the better, normal speed 50mm/sec<br>
2.temperature : lower the better, find the minimum temp and use that<br>
3.fill density : lower density saves material but lowers the structural robustness<br>
4.speed in between printing layers. We can make it wait in between layers for the plastic to solidify<br>
5.thickness of the layer : 100 micron is standard. 60 is great, anything below, don't bother. 150 if you are in a hurry<br>
<p>Note : For troubleshooting Ultimaker 2, <a href="http://support.3dverkstan.se/article/23-a-visual-ultimaker-troubleshooting-guide#elephant">http://support.3dverkstan.se/article/23-a-visual-ultimaker-troubleshooting-guide#elephant</a></p>
<h1>Day 8</h1> <p><b>(30.10.2015)</b><p>

<p>Today we learn the operation and how to install the <b>"Modella"</b>.
<p>Milling in Wax Block: Every dimension minus 10mm. That is, height, depth, etc . Take care of the maximum depth you can go while designing according to the size of the milling bit. The parameter in Fab Modules is clearance which take account of the mill length.</p>
<p>We didn't get time to mill as we got stuck in Laser cutting the Modella base. But covered all everything needed to be done in the software side. Important points to be noted are.</p>
<p>Design from antimony has to be exported as heightmap, which is basically .png file.<br> 
later came to notice that exporting as .png had some bad effects on the cut, so better export as .stl and use that in fabmodules.<br>

<p><img src="img/48.png"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
<p><img src="img/49.png"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>
<p>Open fabmodules and give input as .png/.stl and select the Modella as machine.<br>
Afterwards select the exported file and select initially the cut as rough cut and after finishing the rough   cut do the final cut.<br></p>
<p>3,designed and the one shown in fabmodules. If there's any, correct it.<br> 
<p><img src="img/50.jpg"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>

Select the workflow (program)
<p><img src="img/52.png"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>
<p>Setting values in fabmodules is as follows<br>
give the right dia od the bit we are using.<br>
give the overlap as .5 rather than .25 which loads as default.<br> 
look if their is any disparity in the dimensions of the one you<br></p>
choose the origin according to the placement of your wax block. 
make .rml and send it to the modella.<br> 
<p><img src="img/53.png"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>

<h1>Day 9</h1> <p><b>(31.10.2015)</p></b>
Today we learn the operation and how to install the <b>"ShopBot and catchup "</b>

<p>Design for milling: day we started with that. Gave a Design done by Puneeth.  
Reviewed the documentation done by all. Franc told what all needed to be done in extra. Cleared all the
doubts/roadblocks preventing documentation.

Yesterday I designed  the object using the Antimony software 

<h2>Week 3</h2>
<h>Day 10 (02.11.2015)</h1>

<h>Electronics Production</h>

<p>Today we going to study the electronics area, Mr. Francisco give a basic thinks and basic idea for electrician. What is electrician ? <p>Where we use electrician ?. </p>

<p><b>Basic electronics</b></p>

<p><b>switch </b></p>

<p><img src="img/60.jpeg"style="width:200px;height:200px;"></p>
<p>A switch responds to an external force to mechanically change an electric signal. Switches are used to turn electric circuits ON and OFF and to switch electric circuits. Basically what this means is that when you push down or flick a switch you are allowing current to flow through to the rest of the circuit.</p>

We have many different kinds of switches the most common are
Toggle Switch, Push button Switch, Selector Switch</p>

<p><b>Diodes</b></p>

<p><img src="img/61.jpeg"style="width:200px;height:200px;"></p>
<p>A Diode is the simplest two-terminal unilateral semiconductor device. It allows current to flow only in one direction and blocks the current that flows in the opposite direction. The two terminals of the diode are called as anode and cathode. The characteristics of a diode closely match to that of a switch. An ideal switch when open does not conduct current in either directions and in closed state conducts in both directions</p>

There are many different types of diodes the most common are:
Zener Diode: The Zener Diode allows current in reverse direction when the applied voltage reaches the breakdown voltage. (Based of principle of zener breakdown.)</p>

<p><img src="img/62.png"style="width:400px;height:200px;"></p>
Light Emitting Diode: The LED converts current into light. This type of diode is especially popular and is most commonly found in small electronics stop street lights and we may even see it finding its way into house lighting being cheaper and more Eco friendly.</p>

<p><b>Resistor </b></p>

<p><img src="img/63.png"style="width:400px;height:200px;"></p>
The resistor is a passive two pole component used to limit the amount of current that is allowed to flow at any given time as well as the voltage. </p>

<p><b>capacitor</b></p>

<p>A capacitor is a two-terminal, component used to temporarily store a charge in an electric feild. This is use full in Electrical Engineering because it can be used to smooth out varying DC supplies aswell as filtering circuits (high pass, low pass or band pass) they are even used as temporary batteries.</p>

The most common types of capacitors you will find are:
Supercap: Also known as a ultracapacitor, as the name implies these capacitors have very large amounts of capacitance.</p>

Elecrtrolytic Capacitor: These are a type of capacitor that are polarised (they can only work in one direction) these are able to offer high capacitance values mostly above 1 μF. these are mostly used for low friquency applications</p>

Ceramic Capacitor: Is a type of capacitor are that can store a charge anywhere from a picofarad to around 0.1 microfarad.</p>

<p><b>Transistors</b></p>

<p><img src="img/64.jpeg"style="width:200px;height:200px;"></p>
Transistors are is a small mostly 3 pole component made of elements in the group 4 in the periodic table, Silicon being the most common. To understand it think of it like this, Your brain has billions upon billions of neurons. The neurons let you think and remember things, Computers act the same way except the computers neuron is called a Transistor.</p>

<p><b>Potentiometer </b></p>

<p><img src="img/65.jpeg"style="width:200px;height:200px;"></p>
A Potentiometer is a knob that has variable resistance which can result in the dimming of your lights or even sending information back to your micro controller this component normally has 3 poles also called a 3 pole resistor it works in the same way as a voltage divider except for the fact that this has variable outputs. You will often find these in house holds or sound controllers.</p>

<p><b>Motors</b></p>

<p><img src="img/66.jpeg"style="width:200px;height:200px;"></p>
Motors is a device that converts direct current into mechanical power. They rely on the forces produced by magnetic fields. It does this by having a coil of wire with a current running through it generates an electromagnetic field. The direction and magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the coil can be changed with the direction and magnitude of the current flowing through it.</p>

The most common types of motors are</p>

DC motors : This Motors simply starts spinning if you give it DC connection the speed and direction all depends on the arrangement of the positive and negative poles as well as the amount of current you put through it.</p>

Servo Motors: These motors are awesome because they can turn to any specific location within 660 or 180 depending on the servo we have .</p>

Stepper Motors: The main difference between them and all the other motors, is the way they revolve. Unlike other motors, stepper motors does not continuously rotate Instead, they rotate in steps . Each step is a fraction of a full circle. This fraction depends mostly from the mechanical parts of the motor, and from the driving method.</p>

<p><b>PCB Fabrication</b></p>

We started to downloading the Electronic Production assignment file form Fab academy 2015 archives. 
We chose to mill the HelloISO board designed by Neil. Opened it in Antimony got the Trace .png and Outline .png.

The next step is to open Fab Modules and give .png as the input format, select modella as the machine. Then load the traces .png file and then make path. Leave the settings as default.
<p><b>type:</p></b>"fab" - Enter 
<p><img src="img/67.1.png"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p> 

<p>Select the i/p format (.png file)<br>
Select the o/p process (Roland MDX-20 mill(.rml))<br>
Select the workflow (make_png_rml)<br>

<p><img src="img/67.png"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>
select top first "mill traces(1/64)"<br>
click the "load.png" button and select our project work(.png).<br>

click the "make.path" button and view type select "segments"<br>

click the "make.rml" button and the project job send it to the PCB Milling machine.<br>
<p><img src="img/68.png"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>

<p><img src="img/69.png"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>
select top first "mill traces(1/32)"<br>
click the "load.png" button and select our project work(.png).<br>

click the "make.path" button and view type select "segments"<br>

click the "make.rml" button and the project job send it to the PCB Milling machine.<br>
<p><img src="img/70.png"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>
<p>Now move onto the machine, Switch it on. Change the bit carefully to 1/64 for milling the traces. Using the Fab Module move the head to the point where you want the origin to be. Then correct the height of the bit. We want to have it just touching the surface.
Now in the Fab Modules give make .rml command and then send it to modella. Wait till the work is done. After cutting the traces change the bit to 1/32 and repeat the process using Fab Modules using cut board .png fil. This will make a cut around our circuit so that we can remove it from the larger board.</p>
<p><img src="img/71.jpg"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>
<p>Now as we have the board, it’s time to start soldering the components to it. As a good practice, Mr.Francisco told all to write down the components in a paper or book and draw a box corresponding to each component. Then we took the components and placed them in their corresponding boxes. This way we won’t mix up anything and it's easy to solder as the components are kept handy.</p>
The final product is like:
<p><img src="img/72.jpg"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>

After soldering we have to check under the magnifier if the connections are proper and if time allows, do a continuity check too.
Programming the Board<br>

The prerequisites for programming your board are<br>

    <p>1.Latest version of avrdude in our PC<br>
    2.A mini USB cable<br>
    3.firmware of the board<br>

<p>When you have all the above try to flash the Firmware into the board.<br>
 The steps to be followed are<br>

    <p>download and extract the firmware<br>
    open a terminal over there and give the following commands<br>
        make clean<br>
        make hex : If we are using an Atmelice isp make that change in the makefile [change to atmelice_isp]. If ywe are using USBtiny then change to that.<br>
        sudo make fuse : its run Successfully.<br>
        sudo make program .<br>
   last our board should be programmed to work as an ISP.<br>
     The soldering jumper should be removed after flashing the firmware.

<h1>Day 11 (03.11.2015)</h1>

<h><b>Kokopelli</b></h>

<p>Today we going to study the Kokopelli, Mr. Francisco toled that in MIT all PCB designer are use Kokopelli software. It is more power full and safe. We design a circuit in Kokopelli software, that file to easily modified by other designer in the world. So we start working with Kokopelli. First we take a circuit from fab Academy site and download the circuit .cad file, that cad file open with Kokopelli. </p>
<p><img src="img/74.png"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>

<p>Add  three extra component in to the circuit, like(LED,Resistor and button switch).The programs are shown the figure</p>

<p><img src="img/75.png"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>

After finishing the design we save the file to .png and that file give to the PCB milling machine .

<h><b>Video Conferencing and catchup time</b></h>

<p><b>Video Conferencing</b></p>

<p>Its very important to have a video conferencing facility in every FAB labs. It would be the window that connects to the rest of the labs and MIT. So setuped our lab conference facility using a combination of Ekiga and a stable internet connection. Franc also explained how the communications will be done during fab academy course, how to use the mcu.cba.mit.edu and how to navigate aroud the channel etc.
We did a test conference with Fab Lab Barcelona to check the connections and to give us a feel of how it is.The FAB Lab 1 Internet connection is 1 mbps(1:1), it dedicated to video colling facility
I too installed Ekiga,tried to connect to mcuc.cba.mit.edu it's work properly </p>

<p><b>ShopBot</b></p>

Mr.Franc toled the ShopBot PRSalpha tools are our toughest, most sophisticated, gantry-based CNC routers. Using advanced technology for CNC cutting, drilling, carving and machining, the PRSalpha series tools deliver rapid transit speeds of 1800 inches per minute and cutting speeds of up to 600 inches per minute. Easy to configure and re-configure,learn and use, the PRSalpha CNC delivers affordable, full-production performance in digital fabrication of wood, plastic, aluminum, and other materials. our shopbot bead is 8feetx4feet.
next we discussed about the design parameteres and how to install the 2D works software using wine. there were no problems durinf installation. Franc also made some 2D desing that design to share to our DropBox account .

<h>Day 14 (10.11.2015)</h1>

<h>Rhino</h>

Designing in Rhinoceros

<p>A new software was introduced to us today called rhino which is used for 2D as well as 3D drawings. I is a very powerful tool for making models for laser cutting, milling wax and for 3D printing. Luciano asked us to download and install the software. As It was a windowls/mac only software, my system was Ubuntu OS so it is not work in my system. I shifted to one of the windows system in FabLab and installed and tried some tools to design in 2d and 3D.</p> 

<p><b>ShopBot</b></p>

<p>As we didn't use the ShopBot till day Luciano decided to try it.
He quickly drew a simple design in Rhino and exported it as .dxf file, opened it Vcarve and gave the profiles and the drill bit/tool used for each job. As I am quite familiar with the machine it was easy to follow. The things I learned new are how to determine the pass depth, which is half of the dia of the bit used, what is feed rate, plunge rate, stepover etc.</p>
<p><img src="img/86.jpg"style="width:600px;height:400px;"></p>
After completing the design and creating the profiles for cutting and drilling, we passed on the files to the jobcontrol software of ShopBot which did the rest.
