<h><b>Fab Foundation Mission</h></b>
<p>The Fab Foundation was formed February 9, 2009 to facilitate and support the growth of the international fab lab network through the development of regional Fab Foundations and organizations. The Fab Foundation is a US non-profit organization that emerged from MIT Center for Bits & Atoms Fab Lab Program. Fab Foundation mission is to provide access to the tools, the knowledge and the financial means to educate, innovate and invent using technology and digital fabrication to allow anyone to make anything</p>
<h><b>Fab Foundation Board</h></b>
<p>Sherry Lassiter - President,
Neil Gershenfeld - Chairman of the Board,
Stuart Gannes  -Vice President,
Simone Amber - Board Member &
Chris Wilkinson - Board Member</p>
<h><b>Fab Lab Network</h></b>
<p>The Fab Lab Network is an open, creative community of fabricators, artists, scientists, engineers, educators, students, amateurs, professionals, ages 5 to 75+, located in more than 40 countries in approximately 200 Fab Labs. From community based labs to advanced research centers, Fab Labs share the goal of democratizing access to the tools for technical invention. This community is simultaneously a manufacturing network, a distributed technical education campus, and a distributed research laboratory working to digitize fabrication, inventing the next generation of manufacturing and personal fabrication.

<h><b>Fab Lab tour for participants</h></b>

<p>Mr Francisco Sanchezz showing and explain the all machine's and equipment's in the FAB Lab KERALA. The equipment's and machine's are listed bellow :</p>

<p>1. Shopbot PRSAlpha-96-48-6 Full Size PRSalpha CNC<br> 
2. Weller WES51 Analog Soldering Station<br> 
3. Ultimaker 2<br>
4. Modela miller<br>
5. Laser cutter<br>
6. Digital Storage Oscilloscope<br>
7. 3D printer. Dimensions sst 12000es<br>
8. Scroll Saw<br>
9. Band Saw<br>
10. Molding and Casting<br>
11. Electronics workbench</p>
<p>The FAB Academy course is a six month duration course. When we attend the FAB Academy course we must completed the Pre FAB Academy course (4 weeks). He explained why we need a Prefab training and how it will help us while we take the Fab Academy course. Then Francisco first collect all students name & mail id and shared some documents in a folder via. google drive which we will use to store and share files. Then we had a discussion on what we will be doing in the first week in detail</p>
<h><b>Day 2 (20.10.2015)</h></b>
<p>Second day we started with how to prepare the documentation and debugging table. Francisco teached us to keep a separate note book for writing down all the points during the course of the workshop. It is insisted to use the same notebook if you are attending the FAB academy course</p> 

<p>Exp: we work in laser cutter, we need to note the bellow things</p>

<p>1.Date<br>
2.Machine used<br>
3.Material (thickness, type, colo...)<br>
4.Settings (speeds, feed rates...)<br>
5.Results (what worked, what didn't)<br>
6.Debugging</p>
The debugging time we make a work table.

<h4><b>Assignment:</h4></b> 
<h>Document what you do every day.</h>
<p>The documentation shall be done in such a way that in case of doing a machine operation Name of the work Name of the machine Spec Settings Measurements (if any) Having never used ubuntu before, when Francisco asked to install Ubuntu 14.4. My Laptop Specs: Model: Dell Inspiron 15z-5523 Ultrabook Processor: 3rd Gen Intel Core i7 processors and the performance-enhancing features of Windows 10 with 8 GB RAM. First am partition my hard disk, but its note it's not booting their. Francisco sad to me if your interested in the course you un install the windows and install the Ubuntu 14.04. I accept the advice and I formated and installing the Ubuntu 14.04. The important thing before installation of Ubuntu is to create partitions in the available hard disk space by opening Manage, Computer Management, Storage. My friend give a bootable pendrive with Ubuntu 14.04 OS.</p> 

<p>Boot from the pendrive. plugging in the boot able pendrive with Ubuntu 14.04 restart the computer and choose to boot from the pendrive. I  have to change my boot preferences by hitting the Setup (F12) key while my computer is restarting.</p>

<p>Navigate through the top menu bar and you can find Legacy Boot [Enable] [Disable] Press F10 and Save. Ubuntu opens up next objective is to create three partitions namely /, home and swap area. For / Memory : Primary Ext 24 Allocate space as per your choice (50 GB) For /home Memory: logical Ext 24 Space allocated: 100 GB For swap area Space allocated: 16 GB Install Ubuntu</p> 

<p><img src="img/1.jpg"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
Press the "Install Ubuntu" button.
<p><img src="img/2.jpg"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
click the "Continue" button.
<p><img src="img/3.jpg"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>

<p><img src="img/5.jpg"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
select our keyboard layout "English (US)"
<p><img src="img/6.jpg"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
After install, enter our Name, Computer Name and Password. press the "Continue" button
<p>Once we have completed installing Ubuntu, update the OS by opening the Terminal (Ctrl+alt+t). apt-get update If this shows permission denied use the below command sudo apt-get update (sudo means super user do) Once you have successfully updated Ubuntu, the next step is to download the dependencies and for which log on to kokompe.cba.mit.edu Once that is done next step is to download the fab modules Unzip the fab module,open the folder, right click select open terminal here. If you couldnt find it you need to install nautilus (file manager) sudo apt-get install nautilus Install fab modules Then downlaod kokopelli.retro.zip (shared by francisco) extract make fab cd bin ./kokopelli Download antimony Search github antimony Open Intall Qt5.5 (an application, where in you can design software by placing buttons and corresponding codes are generated simultaneously) Install the following Clone antimony (for getting the antimony updated automatically) ~/Qt5.5.1/5.5/gcc_64/bin/qmake ../sb.pro, sudo make -j8, ./app/antimony - Antimony is not getting installed in my computer . Antimony installation time I faced some Problem - It didn't compile correctly for the first time. I ask my friend, he toled me "to delete the entire cloned folder, re-clone it and build again. After next time it got installe". Next time I installed the antimony getting installed successfully.</p> 
<p>Antimony Software instalation tips are shown bellow:</p>
<p><img src="img/8.png"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
open a terminal in Qt5.5 and run
<p><img src="img/9.png"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
<p>Antimony is a computer-aided design (CAD) tool from a parallel universe in which CAD software evolved from Lisp machines rather than drafting tables.<br>
Antimony is built on three mostly-orthogonal axes:

    <p><b>.</b>A framework for tracking information flow through directed acyclic graphs<br>
    <b>.</b>A geometry engine for doing CSG<br>
    <b>.</b>A standard library of shapes and transforms</p>
<p><img src="img/10.png"style="width:700px;height:550px;"></p>
<p>Solid modeling in Antimony is done by connecting nodes in a graph</p>
<p><b>Installed the list of software bellow:</b>

<p>1. inkscape<br>
2. openscad<br>
3. gimp<br>
4. cura<br>
5. arduino IDE (not the ubuntu software center version)<br>
6. attiny addon for arduino IDE<br>
7. processing<br>
8. qcad<br>
9. git<br>
10. eagle<br>
11. kicad<br>

Created a repository in our github account. Configured the git in our computers via terminal. Cloned the repo
created earlier into our PC. Then created an html file containing code to display "Trivandrum FAB Lab" inside the local folder. 

<p>Operation:</p>

<p>create new folder in our desktop - file name: "git"
open the folder and right click the mouse</p> 
<p><img src="img/12.png"style="width:200px;height:200px;"></p>
<p>select the open in terminal<br>
<b>Type:</b><br>

"nano index.html" - Enter<br>
<p><img src="img/13.png"style="width:300px;height:200px;"></p>

<p>Then added it to github repo. Did my initial commit and then Pushed everything.

git add index.html - Enter<br>
git commit -m”first commit” - Enter<br></p>

<p>pushed to cloud
<p><b>Type:</b>

<h2>Day 4 <p>(22.10.2015)</p></h2>

<p>We started with Francisco educating us Time management - Supply vs Demand-based time, serial vs parallel<br>
development, Spiral development, bottom-up vs top-down debugging (solve the problem or the cause)<br>

<p>Afternoon FAB Lab Trivandrum, Keep it clean and take the inventory, prepare the inventory list.
my Cleaning job aria - Electronics workbench and consumables</p>
